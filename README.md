# Render
Render is a mysterious entity that haunts Blockland. Over the years, this entity has become increasingly intelligent... and increasingly deadly.

# The Glitch Detector
Introducing the newly-upgraded Glitch Detector 2.0! This tool will alert you to the presence of Render by measuring glitch energy. It has one weakness, however; Render can passively observe you without being detected.

# The Glitch Gun
This state-of-the-art device was invented during an experiment with glitch energy. Upon use, a glitch gun will repel Render, shattering the gun in the process. Not much else is known about this device or if there are other uses of the technology.

# Glitch Shrines
The Glitch Shrine is a brick that you can place in your builds to passively repel Render. Glitch Shrines have the appearance of a Jack-o-lantern.

You can turn a shrine off by using a wrench on it and unchecking "Raycasting" in the menu. You can also do this with events!

# Detector Bricks
These are special bricks that trigger **onRelay** when Render is nearby. You can use these to make automated alarm systems and other things.

# Events
You can configure Render's behavior using events! To use them, you need to create a minigame. They only work if you are the mini-game owner.

- MiniGame -> setRenderInvincibility
- MiniGame -> setRenderMode
- MiniGame -> setRenderSpawnRate

# What's New
This is an entirely new Renderman mod built from the ground up. Here's a brief list of what sets it apart from previous mods:
- Improved AI and movement; Render navigates your builds rather than teleporting through them.
- New, original sound effects created specifically for the mod.
- No more loud "BEEEEP" sound. You may now safely turn up your volume.
- No more "kick players" pref.
- A new and improved detector. (See above)
- Fixed a bug with the spawn rate; you no-longer need to adjust it when more players join.
- Updated shrine bricks.
- Tons of misc. bugs and issues fixed.

# Development
I have plenty of plans for improvements! This mod will continue to receive updates for the foreseeable future.
Developers, the add-on can be found on GitHub. Contributions are welcome. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/LakeYS/blockland-render)

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a polished survival horror experience that conforms to Blockland's non-linear gameplay style.

# Project Accomplishments
Here are a few things that have been successfully accomplished in this project.
- A lightweight node generator for spawning and movement that can, in many cases, detect and navigate around corners of players' builds.
- Original sound effects and ambience created specifically for the mod.
- A functioning set of "horror mechanics" that do not utilize jumpscares.
- Interactive items, events (scriptable elements), configuration, and brick types that allow for more customizable gameplay.
