# Render
Render is a mysterious entity that haunts Blockland. Over the years, this entity has become increasingly intelligent... and increasingly deadly.



# Tools
## The Glitch Detector
Introducing the newly-upgraded Glitch Detector 2.0! This tool will alert you to the presence of Render by measuring glitch energy. It has one weakness, however; Render can passively observe you without being detected.

## The Glitch Gun (Coming soon)
This state-of-the-art device was invented during an experiment with glitch energy. Upon use, a glitch gun will repel Render, shattering the gun in the process. Not much else is known about this device or if there are other uses of the technology.

# Glitch Shrines
The Glitch Shrine is a brick that you can place in your builds to passively repel Render. Glitch Shrines have the appearance of a Jack-o-lantern.

You can turn a shrine off by using a wrench on it and unchecking "Raycasting" in the menu. You can also do this with events!

# Preferences
- Spawn Rate
- Damage Type
- Only spawn at night?
- Shrine Range

# What's New
- Improved AI and movement; Render navigates your builds rather than teleporting through them.
- New, original sound effects created specifically for the mod.
- No more loud "BEEEEP" sound. You may now safely turn up your volume.
- A new and improved detector. (See above)

# Media
Screenshots, videos, etc. will be featured here.

# Development
I have plenty of plans for improvements! This mod will continue to receive updates for the foreseeable future.

Developers, the add-on can be found on GitHub. Contributions are welcome. [View on GitHub]

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a polished survival horror experience that conforms to Blockland's non-linear gameplay style.

# Project Accomplishments
Here are a few things that have been successfully accomplished in this project.
- A lightweight node generator for spawning and movement that can, in many cases, detect and navigate around corners of players' builds.
- Original sound effects and ambience created specifically for the mod.
- A functioning set of "horror mechanics" that do not utilize jumpscares.
