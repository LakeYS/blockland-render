# blockland-render
A survival horror mod that introduces Render, a mysterious entity that haunts Blockland. Currently work-in-progress.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to create a polished survival horror experience that conforms to Blockland's non-linear gameplay style.

#Accomplishments
Here are a few things that have been successfully accomplished in this project.
- A lightweight node generator for spawning and movement that can, in many cases, detect and navigate around corners of players' builds.
- Original sound effects and ambience created specifically for the mod.
- A functioning set of "horror mechanics" that do not utilize jumpscares.
